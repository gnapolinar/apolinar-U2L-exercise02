        <h2>Autobiography</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Gwinneth Apolinar, a BS Computer Science student with a passion for graphic desigining. 
          I graduated with honors in senior highschool on Canossa School City of Santa Rosa.
           I am currently studying in University of the Philippine Los Banos Laguna. Since then, 
           I've gained experience in Computer Science through various roles and projects. So far, 
           my journey in UPLB made me learned various programming languages like python, dart, C, and so on. 
           When, I'm not studying, I enjoyed watching tutorials about adobe photoshop since it is part of my stress reliever. 
           I believe that is important to work smart and not hard in order to achieve my goals. 
           Nevertheless, feel free to view my portforlio to see my projects and skills.</p>
