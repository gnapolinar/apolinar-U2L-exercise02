Steps on how to create GitHub page:
1. First, I created the flexbox layout by deciding how will i format my website portfolio
2. Then, I created the flex-containers which will hold my flex-items, I created 5 flex-containers for this layout.
3. After creating the layout, I created the logo and inserted the featured photo and logo in the layout.
4. Lastly, I designed the flex-containers and flex-items by setting their color, font-size, background, padding, etc.

Key Takeaways:
1. As I have watched tutorials in youtube about flexbox, I realized that aligning and positioning items in html and css ave become easier due to flexbox. Since, before you have to set their position manually to adjust there alignment.
2. I also realized that creating a webpage is not easy since you have to add a lot of elements to configure the design in the webpage.
